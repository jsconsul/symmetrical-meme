Nobel Prize winner Jennifer Doudna thinks it could be!\\n\\nJuergen Eckhardt, Head of Leaps by Bayer recently discussed the transformative potential of #CRISPR technology with Jennifer Doudna, who co-developed this method for gene editing. \\nThe CRISPR space is developing at a rapid pace. The first FDA-approved CRISPR therapy for sickle cell disease has rolled out and Doudna remains optimistic about gene editing\\'s future.\\n\\nKey insights from the Magazine Forbes article: \\n     - The first CRISPR therapy, approved by the Food and Drug Administration at the end of 2023, can effectively cure a disease that was once untreatable. \\n     - Clinical pipelines are advancing rapidly, with Intellia Therapeutics achieving effective in vivo editing with a single injection\\n     - CRISPR treatments are showing remarkable results - reducing bad cholesterol by up to 80% in early trials \\n     - The biggest technical challenge isn\\'t CRISPR itself but delivery systems for the enzymes\\nBeyond medicine, Doudna is particularly bullish on CRISPR\\'s impact in agriculture, where her team is working on reducing methane emissions from cows and developing drought-resistant rice.\\n\\nBut there are obstacles slowing things down. Here’s what is needed next for CRISPR to make an even bigger impact on the world: \\n     - Regulatory frameworks that embrace CRISPR as a platform technology \\n     - Renewed investor confidence (currently in the \"reality check\" phase of the biotech hype cycle) \\n     - Continued support for basic, curiosity-driven research\\n\\nAs Doudna noted, \"Innovation comes a lot of times from just studying things that initially don\\'t have a connection to what you want to do, but in the end, you find out they are connected.\"\\n\\nEckhardt sees the value in investing in this innovation as well.

It is also at the heart of a global challenge: climate change and its impact on global food security.  \\n\\nWith over half the world's population relying on rice as a daily food staple, regenerative agricultural practices like Direct Seeded Rice (DSR) are crucial. Here’s why: \\n\\n     🌏 Climate impact → Flooded paddy fields, traditionally used to grow rice, not only use a lot of water, they also emit 12% of global methane emissions—a potent greenhouse gas. But by removing the need for flooded fields, DSR conserves water, reduces emissions, and protects the soil. \\n\\n     🍚 Food security → With the global population expected to increase to 10 billion by 2050, it is estimated that rice production will need to increase by 35% to meet demand.

Greater transparency will help regulators, industry and civil society make better‑informed decisions, reduce unnecessary testing, and foster trust among stakeholders.\\nAs part of ICCA, BASF members played an active role in developing the guide in cooperation with associations, companies and other interested parties.

Based on its strong intellectual property and experience, INOCAS aims to plant at least 50,000 hectares of Macaúba in partnership with smallholder farmers by 2030. This system supports regenerative agriculture by combining forestry and livestock farming without an additional land use change. It has positive impacts on soil quality, erosion control and biodiversity. Agricultural partnerships with smallholder farmers aim at improving livelihoods for their families. \\nThe partnership also includes financing of INOCAS’ plans to develop the Macaúba oil production in Brazil on an industrial scale.
