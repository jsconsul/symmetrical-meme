## Strong Buying / Need Signals
(High intent – these almost always mean active evaluation or imminent purchase)

- Explicitly asking for vendor recommendations, RFPs, or “who’s the best at X?”
- Posting “We’re evaluating tools for [exact problem you solve]” or “migrating away from [current vendor]”
- Announcing a formal procurement/tender process
- Publicly complaining about their current provider by name (e.g., “Vendor X is killing us with downtime”)
- Posting a detailed job description that is literally the role your tool replaces (e.g., “Hiring 5 full-time data-cleaning analysts”)
- Announcing new funding + explicitly saying “part of it will go to [your category] infrastructure”
- Mentioning hard deadlines driven by regulation, audit, or contract end (e.g., “Must be SOC 2 Type II by Q2 or we lose enterprise deals”)
- Leadership says “We need to fix [problem] this quarter” or “Budget approved for [your category]”
- They share a public Notion / Google Doc / RFP spec sheet related to your solution
- Announcing a major tech stack change that directly requires your category (e.g., “Moving everything to Kubernetes in 2026”)

## Moderate Buying Signals
(They’re likely in research or budgeting mode)

- Repeatedly posting about the same pain point over weeks/months
- Leadership or engineers venting about specific operational frustrations (without naming vendors yet)
- Hiring spree in the exact department your tool would help (e.g., 10 security engineers in 3 months)
- Announcing headcount growth of 50–200%+ (scaling pains incoming)
- Publicly sharing internal OKRs or north-star metrics that your tool directly moves
- Engaging heavily with your competitors’ content (likes, comments, shares)
- Their employees ask technical questions that your product answers
- Posting “We’re building vs buying [your category]” (even if they say building, many end up buying)
- Sudden spike in content about a new strategic initiative that needs your category (e.g., “All-in on generative AI”)
- Mentioning cost-cutting initiatives while still growing fast → ripe for efficiency tools

## Weak Buying Signals
(Low immediacy, but worth tracking)

- General “We’re growing fast / exciting times ahead” posts
- New funding announcement with no details on allocation
- Leadership becomes much more active on LinkedIn/Twitter
- Generic “digital transformation” or “cloud journey” buzzwords
- Hiring engineers/managers in adjacent areas (e.g., more frontend devs when you sell backend tools)
- Re-sharing industry reports about problems you solve
- Vague “partnership opportunities” posts
- Celebrating new office, anniversary, or generic milestone
- Sudden increase in branded swag / culture content (often signals funding + growth mode)
- Attending every major conference in your space

## Hidden / Pattern-Based Signals
(Require watching a company over time – often the earliest and strongest when combined)

- Tone shift: From polished marketing to raw, frustrated engineering/ops posts
- Persistent Pain Loop: Same problem mentioned 5+ times in 90 days with no resolution announced
- Employee chatter in comments: “We really need to fix this,” “So much manual work,” “Hiring can’t keep up”
- Sudden drop in posting frequency or quality → internal fire-fighting
- Leadership changes in relevant roles (new CTO, VP Engineering, Head of Infrastructure, CISO)
- They start educating their audience on a topic your tool solves (thought-leadership pivot = they’re deep in it)
- Aggressive new keyword adoption (e.g., suddenly every post mentions “RAG,” “finops,” “zero trust”)
- Their engineers start answering Quora / Stack Overflow / Reddit questions about problems you solve
- Spike in job postings that quietly get taken down (failed internal build → likely buying)
- They begin publicly benchmarking or admitting gaps vs competitors
- Unusually high engagement on pain-related posts (lots of “same here!” comments)
- They start following your company + all your competitors in the same week
- Their marketing team posts “2026 priorities” slides that include your category
- Ex-employees of your customers start joining them (they bring knowledge of your tool)
- Sudden increase in G2 / Capterra / TrustRadius activity from their domain
