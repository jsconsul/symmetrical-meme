"Diabetes goes far beyond excessive sugar consumption.

Diabetes management is not just about controlling sugar, carbohydrate intake also plays a vital role. When the body processes carbohydrates, they break down into glucose, elevating blood sugar levels and potentially accelerating kidney damage.

Nearly 40% of people with Type 2 Diabetes (#T2D) develop Chronic Kidney Disease (#CKD). But, early detection and healthier lifestyle choices can make all the difference. The Urine Albumin-Creatinine Ratio (#UACR) test can detect elevated albumin levels, an early indicator of kidney complications, supporting timely intervention and treatment.

Switching to low-carbohydrate diets, staying active, and getting regular health checks are powerful steps toward protecting kidney health and improving overall well-being.

With over 89 million adults living with diabetes in India alone, many remain undiagnosed. Together with Diabetes India, Bayer's nationwide CHECK campaign aims to screen 100,000 T2D patients using the UACR test.

This #WorldDiabetesDay, it's all about CHECKing in time, and protecting in time.

"Enquanto o mundo acelera para conter os impactos da crise climática, o agro pode ser parte da solução. Agricultores brasileiros já mostram que são protagonistas quando o assunto é a implementação de práticas regenerativas e sustentabilidade no campo.  

Produzir Mais. Restaurar a Natureza. Escalar a Agricultura Regenerativa. Essa é a visão da Bayer para o futuro da agricultura. Mas estratégia nenhuma se sustenta sozinha. Caminhamos junto com agricultores e parceiros para promover o aumento da produção de alimentos, da renda agrícola e da resiliência em meio às mudanças climáticas, impactando positivamente a natureza.  

Quem transforma mesmo são as pessoas no campo, e isso já está acontecendo. Aline Vick, agricultora à frente da Fazenda Estância e integrante do projeto Bayer Forward Farming, é um exemplo disso.

"For 30 million farmers in rural India, survival depends on diesel pumps, which are costly and responsible for 10% of the country’s carbon emissions. Audrey Fillon set out to change that. Today, she is one of 15 winners of the Bayer Foundation Women Entrepreneurs Award 2025.

Through her social enterprise, Oorja Development Solutions Limited, Audrey is replacing diesel with more affordable, solar-powered irrigation, milling, and cooling services.

Her pay-per-use model means even the smallest farmers can access clean energy without upfront costs. The impact is already life-changing: incomes up by 27%, more diverse crops grown, and over 3,358 tonnes of CO₂ emissions saved. And this is just the beginning—Oorja aims to build 10,000 solar projects across India by 2030.

"This #NationalCancerAwarenessDay, let's change the narrative around #ProstateCancer.

It’s a silent disease, and most men don’t realize they have it until it’s too late to act.

The reassuring part is that early detection through regular check-ups can lead to timely diagnosis and treatment.

Remember:
- Regular screening isn't optional, it's essential. Informed screenings support early detection and better outcomes, especially for men over 50 or those at higher risk.
- Open conversations aren't awkward, they're lifesaving. Discussing prostate health openly encourages regular screenings and ensures that potential issues are caught early.

Don’t wait until it’s too late and schedule a check-up today!

"Health as the foundation of Africa’s growth 🌍💊

Without healthy citizens, no economy can be sustainable.
Across the continent, policymakers are increasingly aligning around a shared conviction:
health must be recognised as an investment, not a cost, and as the foundation of resilient and inclusive development.

The numbers tell a clear story. Africa has only 3% of the world’s health workers while bearing more than 24% of the world's disease burden.
More than 50% of Africans still lack access to essential health services. And stroke - being part of the top leading causes of death deserves attention.

By 2030, non-communicable diseases are projected to overtake infectious diseases as the leading cause of death.

The implications are both human and economic.

For the private sector, this is not just a moral imperative — it is a strategic opportunity to invest in the continent’s human capital and long-term growth.
Some companies are already taking this path.

Among them, Bayer stands out for its science-driven commitment to cardiovascular and renal health in Sub-Saharan Africa:

💊 providing innovative therapies for chronic kidney disease in Type 2 diabetes,
🩺 training healthcare professionals on stroke prevention and management,
📦 improving treatment availability for non-communicable diseases**, and
🌍 supporting awareness and screening programmes that enable early detection.

The principle of harm reduction captures the essence of this shift:
instead of denying or punishing vulnerabilities, it addresses them pragmatically, preserving life while enabling individuals and communities to move forward and grow.

Africa’s health transformation is therefore not just a public good — it’s a growth frontier for investors, innovators, and policymakers alike.
Because empowering health systems means strengthening economies.

"Menopause is a chapter in life that many women enter quietly, yet it’s a life-changing transition that deserves open conversations.

A global survey of women found that only 20 percent of women feel well-informed about menopause.  Symptoms like hot flashes, sleep disturbances, mood swings, and memory lapses are often endured in silence, leaving many women feeling lost or invisible. 

That's why discussions between women and healthcare providers are crucial to finding meaningful solutions for symptoms. 

At #TeamBayer, we are committed to supporting women on this journey. Together, we can change the narrative – from silence and stigma to openness and support. It is time to amplify the many voices and experiences, ensuring every woman can feel seen, heard, and empowered.

🎙️« La diversité n’est pas un effort, mais une opportunité. Les entreprises qui la cultivent superforment, car elles conjuguent innovation et performance. »

Tout au long de la soirée, la scène du LifeHub a accueilli des intervenantes aux parcours aussi variés qu’inspirants, illustrant la richesse des talents féminins dans les STEM :
	•	Alexandra Banbanaste, pour qui la créativité est une composante essentielle de la recherche scientifique en tant que chercheuse a EPFL  
	•	Auréane SANCHEZ, qui porte haut la voix de la jeunesse et l’importance d’éveiller les vocations dès le plus jeune âge avec Hello Tech Girls - ECE Lyon.
	•	Mounia KHALTNT, qui a partagé son expérience du recrutement dans la tech et rappelé que la parité est un moteur d’innovation.
	•	Et Emilie Rehmann, dont le témoignage a souligné à quel point chaque trajectoire féminine peut devenir une force de transformation.

Au-delà des interventions, cette étape lyonnaise a permis de rassembler tout un écosystème local, entreprises, associations, élus et étudiants, autour d’une même ambition : encourager la diversité pour renforcer la souveraineté et innovation européenne. ✨🧬

Merci à Bayer pour son accueil, son engagement concret et la mobilisation de ses équipes autour de ces enjeux essentiels.

"** New Partnerships Alert ** 

Today, #TeamBayer is announcing partnerships to address some of humanity’s biggest issues in the areas of health and agriculture. 

On health: In collaboration with the WHO Foundation, we’re contributing to global efforts to eliminate tropical diseases like Chagas disease, supporting work to build countries' capacities to incorporate self-care interventions as part of universal health coverage, and supporting the UN cosponsored Human Reproduction Programme (HRP) executed by WHO with a focus on how climate change is affecting sexual and reproductive health.

On agriculture: We’re joining forces with The World Bank to unleash agriculture’s potential to improve livelihoods in developing countries. The partnership includes the following: 

•	Expansion of local seed production in developing countries 
•	Investments in financial tools like crop insurance to support smallholder farmers
•	Exploring trials of wheat crops gene edited to enable nitrogen fixation on African soil. We want to boost yields and improve the environmental profile of one of the world’s most important and nutritious crops: wheat. If field trials are successful, we will work collaboratively to remove barriers to access to this technology across the African continent.

Big challenges demand big collaborations. Team Bayer is committed to playing a leading role."
"Today at 10 am ET, our CEO Bill Anderson will be taking the stage at The World Bank's Live Event, “AgriConnect: Farms, Firms, and Finance for Jobs”, to talk about what we’re doing to turn agriculture into an engine for food security and job creation in developing countries. Check it out!

- #DheesaliFPO’s farmers now have access to high-quality seeds, as well as regular agronomy trainings, strengthening both productivity and confidence. 
- From seed to harvest, FarmRise One’s support has enabled #DharaniAgricultureCooperativeSociety to scale its maize and soya operations (from input procurement to output marketing and sales), strengthen its procurement systems, and provide vital agronomy training that equips its farmers to grow more successfully season after season.

"Did you know? Individuals with chronic kidney disease (CKD) associated with type 2 diabetes (T2D) are three times more likely to die from a cardiovascular (CV) event compared to those with T2D alone.

Over time, elevated blood sugar levels can damage blood vessels, including those in the kidneys. This often leads to albuminuria (a protein found in urine), which serves as an early warning sign of deteriorating kidney health and a risk factor for CV disease, including heart failure.

But here’s the good news: a simple urine test can identify albuminuria early, before significant harm occurs.

That’s why #TeamBayer is raising awareness. Regular testing and early detection in at-risk individuals can significantly impact the protection of both kidney and heart health.

From engaging in pre-season campaigns to introducing digital tools like #FarmRise and #AskDeena, our seven interns were deeply embedded in the field, working across 90 villages in 7 states to help farmers transition to Dry Seeded Rice (DSR) farming. They gained first-hand insights into the future of #SustainableFarming.
 
They engaged directly with farmers, understood local challenges, and facilitated the adoption of mechanized DSR practices—gaining valuable, real-world experience that goes far beyond books. This exposure gave them a unique perspective that only real-world challenges can offer.

"At Bayer, we are committed to fostering a workplace culture that prioritizes the well-being of our employees. Thanks to the dedication of our team, Bayer is becoming a more menopause-friendly workplace. Our Menopause Cafes provide a supportive and inclusive environment for all employees to connect, share experiences, and help break the silence around menopause. These welcoming spaces empower participants to engage in meaningful conversations and support one another during this natural phase of life, both in person and virtual.

In partnership with UNFPA, we focus on driving awareness of the positive impact of menopause friendly policies in the workplace.

We’d love to hear from you! How does your workplace support employees going through menopause, and what initiatives have you found most helpful? Let’s share our experiences and learn from one another!"
"A better harvest starts with access — to the right seeds, the right tools, and the right support.

That’s why we've partnered with Apollo Agriculture, a company helping small-scale farmers across Zambia and Kenya access innovations like Bayer’s drought-resistant corn seeds. By connecting farmers directly with the best crop inputs and financing, Apollo is helping rural communities grow enough food and more opportunity.

Thanks to Apollo, a Leaps by Bayer portfolio company, these solutions are reaching more than 325,000 farmers in Africa. Recently, our CEO Bill Anderson visited Apollo in Zambia to see firsthand how this collaboration is improving lives on the ground.

Together, we’re building a future where every farmer has the chance to thrive. 🌱🌍

"Have you ever considered that your heart continuously pumps 5 liters of blood every single day – an extraordinary organ! However, when it's damaged or under strain, its ability to function can be compromised.

🧬TTR or prealbumin plays a crucial role in the transport of vitamin A and thyroid hormone in the body. In some cases, due to an inherited mutation or aging, TTR falls apart, misfolds, and the smaller pieces then clump together, forming amyloid fibrils that accumulate in the heart. This condition is known as transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy (ATTR-CM) and eventually leads to serious complications such as heart failure.

By raising awareness and improving early recognition, we can change outcomes for those living with this fatal disease. #TeamBayer is committed to improving care for the ATTR-CM community.

"Climate change is not gender-neutral. It significantly affects women — impacting sexual, reproductive, maternal, and menopausal health — and increases risks of gender-based violence, mental health challenges, and unemployment. Research conducted by Economist Impact, supported by Bayer, highlights that women, particularly in low- and middle-income countries, face greater exposure to climate hazards. They often have fewer resources to adapt and encounter more barriers to accessing healthcare.

Addressing these challenges requires inclusive and responsive action. That means improving healthcare access, raising awareness and education, and strengthening data, research, and monitoring to better understand and respond to women’s needs.

Bayer is committed to being part of the solution. Through partnerships and initiatives like The Challenge Initiative, the Your Life Campaign, WomenHeart and Vitamin Angels, we are working to expand access to family planning, promote health education, and provide nutritional support. These efforts help improve the well-being of women and families, building resilience in the face of climate change.

That’s why the Bayer Foundation is supporting the collaboration between Buurtzorg International and Guangxi New Life Healthcare in transforming community-based elder care in China.

What sets Buurtzorg apart is its unique approach: self-organized nursing teams comprised of experts in care, mobility, and functionality training collaborate. The approach empowers caregivers to make decisions that best meet the needs of the elderly, moving beyond traditional assistance to foster independence and dignity. 

This initiative resonates deeply with our Dynamic Shared Ownership operating model, where we believe in empowering the people who do the actual work to make 95 % of the decisions and create solutions that truly matter.

"Over 100 million people in India live with diabetes and the number continues to grow. What’s less known is that diabetes is a major cause of #ChronicKidneyDisease or #CKD, which can develop quietly, without noticeable symptoms.
 
The #UACR (Urine Albumin-to-Creatinine Ratio) test is a simple, non-invasive urine test that helps detect early #kidney damage and potential #cardiovascular risks. It measures albumin, a protein that signals kidney stress, especially in those with diabetes.
 
If you or someone you know is living with diabetes, talk to a healthcare provider about the UACR test. Early detection is key to protecting #KidneyHealth.

Always consult your healthcare professional for further guidance.

The conclave also marked a proud moment for us, with Bayer being recognised with the #AgricultureLeadershipAward2025 for its continued efforts in driving meaningful Agri-transformation.

Mohan Babu Rajaram, Cluster Commercial Lead, Bayer Crop Science (IBSL), emphasised in his session that the future is about convergence where inputs, digital tools, and traditional farming wisdom come together to help farmers achieve better yields, lower post-harvest losses and improved market access.

In another session, Aanand Shrikar, Commercial Digital Lead, Bayer Crop Science (IBSL), mentioned how technology in agriculture is moving from being aspirational to operational. He shared insights on how advanced tech can be adapted to suit Indian realities through remote sensing, AI-driven agronomic insights and localised predictive analytics.

Together, these innovations help make advice actionable, precise, and scalable, even for small and fragmented farms.

At Bayer, we believe that India doesn't just need to grow more food, it needs to grow smarter systems.

"✉️Stamped in time – a small piece and a remarkable journey  

For 125 years, #Team Bayer in Italy has been all in for our customers, farmers, and patients. To celebrate this important milestone, Bayer Italy unveiled something both symbolic and lasting: a special postage stamp, issued by the @Ministry of Enterprise and Made in Italy. Designed in Italy’s national colors, the stamp reflects our three divisions: Crop Science, Consumer Health, and Pharmaceuticals. 

Today, our Milan headquarters opened its doors to celebrate this occasion with a special event. With engaging panel discussions on health and agriculture, the day brought together leaders from politics, media, science, and industry to explore the latest advancements in life sciences, new therapeutic frontiers, and innovative perspectives for European agriculture. 

The discussions, featuring a speech by special guest Stefan Oelrich, President of Bayer Pharmaceuticals and Member of the Board of Management, provided valuable insights into the future, focusing on what Europe and Italy must do to maintain their competitiveness in life sciences innovation.

A highlight: The official ceremonial stamping of the Bayer stamp by Poste Italiane – a fitting way to seal 125 years of impact.

"In the new VOICES episode, I spoke with Bill Anderson, the CEO of Bayer of how organizations need to develop from episodic to perpetual adaptation and about Bayer’s paths to innovation and agility. 

Today’s global environment needs agile organization and artificial intelligence technology. Change is not a project anymore, it’s permanent and essential in rapidly changing environments. I met a leader with a bold vision and a bold company claim with the goal to transform the company thus navigation of change is more sustainable. Bill Anderson is supporting a learning mindset at Bayer. It’s a wonderful and exciting discussion how Bayer is managing to deliver on this powerful promise “Health for all - hunger for none”, even in these turbulent times of transformation and reorganization, also within the company.
 
Two years ago, in June 2023, Bill Anderson took over as CEO. He became CEO of Bayer in very challenging times, not only in the midst of major geopolitical and economic challenges, but also during a major corporate crisis triggered by the purchase of the US seed company Monsanto.
 
What has been achieved in the past two years, since he took up the position by reducing hierarchies, eliminating bureaucracy, streaming structures and accelerate decision-making processes. Where does Bayer stand today, two years later, and in these uncertain geo- and economic times?
 
At a turning point in global economic and security policy, Bayer is pushing ahead with a reorganization under Dynamic Shared Ownership (DSO) to reduce hierarchies and bureaucracy. How far has the company come towards achieving this goal?
 
Bill also speaks about his values in life and if he has ever been afraid of not meeting expectations.

The European Commission has approved extended treatment intervals of up to six months for a treatment option for retinal diseases, like neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD) and diabetic macular edema (DME). This aims to reduce injection frequency, and improve patient adherence.

Retinal diseases such as nAMD and DME can lead to vision loss if untreated. The long treatment intervals offer hope for better management of these diseases.

As the global population ages and diabetes prevalence increases, effective treatments are crucial in combating vision loss and blindness. This approval represents a significant step forward in addressing these unmet medical needs, offering improved management options for patients worldwide.

"Corn is more than meets the eye. It's a vital source of food, feed, and fuel.

That’s why Bayer is working hand-in-hand with farmers to support every step of their corn cultivation journey. Through our Spring and Monsoon Corn Festivals, we conducted 5,700+ workshops across 5 states and 7,600 villages, reaching over 800,000 farmers with high-yield seeds, crop protection solutions, digital tools, and expert guidance.

"Flattening organizations is everywhere in the news, but it's usually just cost-cutting dressed up as transformation. As Bill Anderson, CEO of Bayer, said in an interview published by The New York Times Dealbook, that approach misses the point entirely.

""Most corporate change programs take out heads but not the work,"" Anderson explained. ""They eliminate a layer — usually just one — and leave everything else the same. People are back two years later because the work still has to get done.""

Bayer's taking a different approach. They eliminated five layers of management and pushed average span of control from 5 direct reports to nearly 15. When you're responsible for that many people, you can't micromanage anymore. You have to become more of a mentor and coach instead of a controller.

Anderson and colleagues are also reimagining core processes like resource allocation. Bayer's annual budget process has been scrapped. Instead of spending months on bureaucratic planning, teams now spend one day every 90 days asking: How did we do? What's next? Who do we need? Then they work for 89 days. When Bayer's contraception team needed to win back a major client, they made all the resource decisions themselves—brought in specialists, added medical liaisons—without going up through management layers.

The company's also overhauling HR systems, moving to peer-based performance reviews and scrapping hierarchy-based job grading.

👉 The lesson: to bust bureaucracy, you need to be bold enough to imagine radical alternatives and systematic enough to change all aspects of work—hierarchy, processes, and decision rights together.

Great reporting by Aimee Groth!"

"How is Science in Agriculture Empowering Smallholder Farmers in Zambia?

In Zambia, maize isn't just food—it's livelihood. That's why our expanded seed production facility in this beautiful nation is a game-changer for millions of smallholder farmers.
The innovation lies in our approach to hybrid seed technology:
• We examine the DNA of millions of seeds 
• We cross them to create customized hybrids 
• We select for optimal yield, drought tolerance, and plant resilience

The impact? Farmers who previously struggled with inconsistent yields from open-pollinated varieties are now harvesting 5,000-10,000 kg per hectare — that is enough to feed their families AND sell surplus crops.

As one local farmer told our CEO, Bill Anderson, during his visit: ""I treasure the scientists because they're doing a great job. Having a hybrid variety properly defined with good growth gives me courage and heart to work hard.""

This is the essence of our mission: using cutting-edge science to create tangible improvements in food security and economic opportunity for those who need it most.

"🧬 Could the future of CRISPR result in a Multi-Billion Dollar Market? Nobel Prize winner Jennifer Doudna thinks it could be!

Juergen Eckhardt, Head of Leaps by Bayer recently discussed the transformative potential of #CRISPR technology with Jennifer Doudna, who co-developed this method for gene editing. 
The CRISPR space is developing at a rapid pace. The first FDA-approved CRISPR therapy for sickle cell disease has rolled out and Doudna remains optimistic about gene editing's future.

Key insights from the Magazine Forbes article: 
     - The first CRISPR therapy, approved by the Food and Drug Administration at the end of 2023, can effectively cure a disease that was once untreatable. 
     - Clinical pipelines are advancing rapidly, with Intellia Therapeutics achieving effective in vivo editing with a single injection
     - CRISPR treatments are showing remarkable results - reducing bad cholesterol by up to 80% in early trials 
     - The biggest technical challenge isn't CRISPR itself but delivery systems for the enzymes
Beyond medicine, Doudna is particularly bullish on CRISPR's impact in agriculture, where her team is working on reducing methane emissions from cows and developing drought-resistant rice.

But there are obstacles slowing things down. Here’s what is needed next for CRISPR to make an even bigger impact on the world: 
     - Regulatory frameworks that embrace CRISPR as a platform technology 
     - Renewed investor confidence (currently in the ""reality check"" phase of the biotech hype cycle) 
     - Continued support for basic, curiosity-driven research

As Doudna noted, ""Innovation comes a lot of times from just studying things that initially don't have a connection to what you want to do, but in the end, you find out they are connected.""

Eckhardt sees the value in investing in this innovation as well. Leaps by Bayer has invested in companies that use gene editing across health and agriculture, such as Pairwise, eGenesis, Inc. , Capstan Therapeutics, and Metagenom Bio Life Science because their work also aligns with our mission towards #HealthForAll #HungerForNone.

"Women’s health is not a one-day conversation, but today gives us a moment to reflect on how far we have come and how far we still need to go.

From #reproductive and #menstrual wellbeing to #MaternalCare and chronic conditions, the journey to health equity is long and layered. Too often, women’s symptoms are dismissed, and their voices go unheard. And while progress is being made, many silences still persist, in our conversations, our systems, and how we define care itself.

One of the most persistent silences is around #MenstrualPain, something experienced by billions, yet rarely spoken about openly. In this compelling reflection, Rachana Panda, Cluster Communications Head, South Asia, ASEAN & ANZ at Bayer, sheds light on how menstrual pain is too often dismissed or normalised, urging us to recognise that women’s pain is not just a medical concern, but it’s deeply social, cultural, and long overdue for attention.

At Bayer, we remain committed to addressing these gaps by supporting access to treatment options, raising awareness, and enabling earlier diagnosis in key areas of women’s health. Whether it is managing symptoms that interfere with daily life, addressing nutritional deficiencies, or supporting reproductive choices, our aim is to empower women with greater control over their health, their choices, and their futures.

The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) has issued a positive opinion on eye medication with extended treatment intervals.

If the European Commission follows the CHMP opinion and grants approval, this will address an important unmet need for patients and physicians in two major retinal diseases: neovascular (wet) age-related macular degeneration (nAMD) and diabetic macular edema (DME), giving the option to reduce treatment frequency. Once approved, this can mean for patients and their caregivers less injections and clinic visits, opening capacity for ophthalmologists to treat more patients.

nAMD and DME are conditions that can severely affect individuals' vision if left untreated, leading to challenges in performing everyday activities and diminishing quality of life.

Representing Bayer at the Regional World Health Summit 2025 in New Delhi, sandeep verma, Cluster Head of South Asia for Bayer’s #ConsumerHealth Division, spotlighted the transformative role of #MultipleMicronutrientSupplementation (MMS) and maternal #selfcare in promoting better health for mothers and their babies.

He demonstrated this by talking about how Bayer, through the #NutrientGapInitiative and our global partnerships, is making a difference on the ground. So far, over 20 million women and babies across 20+ countries have been impacted by expanding access to #MMS. The effort also includes an accredited training course for healthcare providers on the importance of MMS and collaboration with local governments to make MMS the standard of care in public health systems.

"Contributions of farmers around the globe play a vital role in feeding our communities and caring for our planet. At #Bayer, we are proud to be part of this journey towards the adoption of sustainable agricultural practices globally.

The Sustainable Markets Initiative, #SMI, is a global coalition of public and private sector organizations that is driving progress in advancing #RegenerativeAgriculture. Bayer is proud to be a partner in this initiative, contributing through our efforts to promote the sustainable cultivation of Basmati Rice. As per the SMI survey 2024, by incorporating regenerative practices, we’ve seen remarkable results in reducing water usage and emissions.

Farmers are not only helping the environment but also reaping the rewards. With a 9% increase in yields and a 20% boost in revenue through export market access, these tangible results demonstrate that regenerative agriculture can drive long-term environmental #sustainability while creating economic opportunities for farmers.

Together, we can build a resilient agricultural landscape that continues to improve the lives of our farmers across the world.

"“It’s just heavy bleeding. It’ll pass.”

That is what millions of women over the world tell themselves, or are told by others, every month.
 
Heavy Menstrual Bleeding, or HMB, is #AnythingButNormal. It can disrupt daily life, drain energy, and affect long-term health. Untreated HMB can result in drastic solutions like a #hysterectomy. But hysterectomy shouldn’t be the first or only option.
 
Through “Preserve the Uterus” campaign, #Bayer's initiative in collaboration with Federation of Obstetric and Gynaecological Societies of India - FOGSI and IHW Council, we are working to raise awareness about alternative treatment options for #HeavyMenstrualBleeding and reduce unjustified hysterectomies.
 
With a view to strengthen women's healthcare, we have signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with National Health Mission (NHM), Government of Kerala. The MoU is a testament of our continued efforts to equip healthcare practitioners and women with the knowledge to make informed medical choices.
 
We also established the country’s first PTU Centre of Excellence in Andhra Pradesh last year to reduce unnecessary hysterectomies.

Let’s recognize #HMB as a health condition that deserves attention, rather than normalizing the pain and ensure that women have access to the information and healthcare they need.

Thanks to new funding secured for an additional three years, the collaboration is poised to become a regional model, as Bayer explores the possibility of replication across other regional countries.

The total value of the partnership since 2021 now stands at EUR 1.33 million — a testament to the strong results achieved in Egypt. The expanded phase aims to reach 810,000 women with information and services, and ensure access to modern contraceptives for 540,000 women by 2028.

"Heart failure is often overlooked, yet it poses a significant challenge to global health, affecting over 64 million people worldwide. Despite advancements in care, individuals with heart failure face survival outcomes comparable to or worse than those diagnosed with some common cancers.

"We're thrilled to announce the expansion of our strategic collaboration with United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) for an additional 3 years, reinforcing our commitment to empowering women's health and family planning in #Egypt! 

Building on the success of our 2021 partnership, this collaboration will now run until 2028, reaching even more women in underserved communities with vital reproductive health services. This extension will also include a significant increase in funding: an additional contribution of additional EUR 100,000 in 2025 by Bayer's Global Health Unit will be made, supported by a long-term commitment of funds of over EUR 900,000 to expand our impact. We’re focusing on Upper Egypt and Frontier Governorates, where the need is greatest.

Since 2021, we’ve already reached approximately 400,000 women with reproductive health and family planning messages and services, exceeding initial targets. This extension supports Bayer’s “Health for all, Hunger for None” mission”, and our commitment to providing 100 million women in low- and middle-income countries with access to modern contraception by 2030 and UNFPA's vision of universal access to voluntary family planning.

In addition, it also contributes towards the UNFPA Strategic Plan (2022-2025) and reaching zero unmet need for family planning, thus contributing to UNFPA’s transformative results.

"Standing up for a cause that’s too often overlooked, over 5,000 men and women came together to raise their voices about #MenstrualPain. Captured through thousands of quick videos, this collective action has earned a Guinness World Records for the largest participation in a national gesture of support while elevating a critical conversation around women’s health.
 
For too long, women have been expected to “tough it out”, making #PeriodPain go unnoticed and untreated. Through this campaign, we’re showing that menstrual pain is real, valid, and deserves attention, not tolerance.
 
Let’s keep the dialogue going.

"Did you know that this iconic Bayer cross has been a landmark in the Leverkusen, Germany night sky since 1958? It not only shapes the cityscape but also serves as a reminder of Bayer's industrial history and economic significance to the region. 💡🌃

Here are 5 fascinating facts about the largest Bayer cross we have:

1️⃣ The Leverkusen cross is the world's largest free-hanging neon sign!
2️⃣ A total of 1,712 LED lights create its stunning illumination.
3️⃣ It has a diameter of 51 meters and hangs from two 118-meter tall masts—the cross itself is 105 meters above the ground at its highest point.
4️⃣ To avoid disturbing migratory birds, the lights are turned off every spring and autumn from 9 PM to 4 AM for several weeks.
5️⃣ In 2007, there was a plan to dismantle the Bayer cross, but the people of Leverkusen responded with protests, petitions, and even a benefit concert—successfully! Today, the question of its removal is no longer on the table.

Hey #TeamBayer, what does the Leverkusen Bayer cross mean to you, and have you ever seen it shining in person? 🌌✨"

"What is better than one potential new treatment option for Parkinson’s Disease? TWO! 

Bayer has achieved something unprecedented: We’re the first company with investigational cell AND gene therapies in the fight against #ParkinsonsDisease. 
 
Where we stand:  
✅ Our investigational cell therapy and gene therapies for Parkinson’s received Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy designation from the FDA 
✅ Our investigational cell therapy for Parkinson’s is advancing into Phase III 
✅ Our investigational gene therapy for Parkinson’s is currently in Phase II  

 
What this means for patients: 
People with Parkinson’s disease still face medical unmet needs, which only worsens as the disease inevitably progresses. We’re striving to change this by developing new innovative treatments aimed at changing the course of the disease. These advancements in the development phase are a huge step forward towards making these treatments a reality for patients.  


We’re not doing it alone: 
🚀 Our innovative work together with AskBio Inc. and BlueRock Therapeutics is aiming at pushing the boundaries of what's possible in Parkinson's treatment. We strive to make a tangible difference in the lives of people with Parkinson’s, so we're going to keep pushing forward!

"This #WorldHealthDay, we draw attention to a growing health crisis: anemia.

In India, a staggering 52.2% of pregnant women between the ages of 15-49 are affected by this condition. When iron levels drop, the risk of anemia rises significantly, especially during pregnancy. This deficiency can lead to severe consequences, including low birth weight, impaired brain development, and a weaker start in life for babies.

At Bayer, we believe every woman deserves the right to proper nutrition. Because healthier mothers mean stronger, healthier generations.

"By 2030, more than 1 billion women will be in menopause. Menopause can substantially affect a woman’s life, but a lack of awareness and care options leaves most symptoms untreated. Each woman’s experience with the menopause transition will be different. 

Menopause usually begins during a period where women are at the peak of their life’s activity and can affect them both at home and in the workplace -- and it is much more than JUST hot flashes. In fact, the most commonly reported and bothersome symptoms during the menopausal transition are hot flashes, sleep disturbances, and mood changes. 

From developing therapeutic options that address menopause symptoms to global physician education efforts, we’re actively broadening women’s options for care that help them maintain their health and quality of life through this transition.

"Forget the old career playbook — work hard, stay put, and follow a straight path. The world of work is evolving, and so should our thinking.

At Bayer, we believe careers aren’t set in stone — they’re built dynamically, shaped by collaboration, learning, and taking ownership of what matters most. So, let’s rethink some outdated career advice:

1.	„Your degree defines your career.""
Reality check: Many people end up working in fields completely unrelated to their degree. Skills, adaptability, and experience matter way more than your major. Many of us at Bayer have taken unexpected, exciting career turns!

2.	""You have to say yes to every opportunity.""
True impact comes from focusing on where you can contribute most. It’s not about saying yes to everything — it’s about making bold, intentional choices.

3.	""Job hopping looks bad on a résumé.""
Not anymore! The world is changing, and so is how we grow. Gaining diverse experiences — inside and outside one role or company — builds valuable perspectives that help us shape the future together.

4.	“A stable 9-to-5 is the safest career choice.""
Stability isn’t just about a traditional job anymore. New working time models and digital careers offer flexibility and new opportunities that traditional jobs can’t always provide.

5.	“You need to have your entire career path figured out in your 20s.""
Nope! Careers aren’t a straight line. The best growth happens when we stay curious, keep learning, and take ownership of our path — wherever it leads.

The truth is: There’s no single ""right"" way to build a career. The key is to stay adaptable, keep learning, and create a path that works for you.

"Bayer impulsa la actualización en nutrición materna para profesionales de la salud

Bayer ha lanzado un programa académico para médicos y especialistas, enfocado en la nutrición desde la preconcepción hasta el posparto. Titulado ""De la preconcepción al posparto: bases nutricionales para un futuro sano"", el programa busca prevenir la anemia y otras complicaciones del embarazo, mejorando la salud materno-infantil en México.

El desafío de la anemia en el embarazo
Según la OMS, el 38% de las mujeres embarazadas en el mundo padecen anemia, lo que aumenta el riesgo de parto prematuro y mortalidad materna. En México, el 11.9% de los niños de 1 a 4 años sufren anemia, afectando su desarrollo físico y cognitivo. Estas cifras resaltan la necesidad de mejorar la nutrición materna.

Expertos internacionales y nacionales
El programa contará con la participación del Dr. Gian Carlo Di Renzo, experto en salud materno-fetal, y otros especialistas mexicanos como:
- Dr. Jorge Montoya Sarmiento: Nutrición preconcepcional y fertilidad.
- Dra. Otilia Perichart Perera: Intervenciones nutricionales en embarazos de alto riesgo.
- Dr. Zigor Campos Goenaga: Nutrición en embarazo adolescente y edad materna avanzada.

Objetivos del programa
El programa ofrece una visión integral de la nutrición materna, abordando necesidades antes, durante y después del embarazo. Incluye información sobre suplementación con hierro y ácido fólico, y estrategias para prevenir la anemia.
La Dra. Itzhae López de Bayer destacó: ""Fortalecer el conocimiento en esta área es clave para prevenir problemas de salud que afectan a las nuevas generaciones.”

Acceso gratuito y certificación
Los profesionales de la salud pueden acceder al programa de forma gratuita y recibirán una certificación al completar el 80% de las sesiones. También tendrán acceso a materiales de referencia y espacios de consulta.

Compromiso de Bayer
Con esta iniciativa, Bayer reafirma su compromiso con la salud materno-infantil, ofreciendo soluciones basadas en evidencia y formación continua para un futuro más saludable en México."

Perhaps you think about a healthy diet, staying fit through movement and sport. Perhaps it is through being proactive by going to your health care provider.

"Water resilience begins with heroes like Shanti Lata Basiwal, who turned adversity into opportunity.

When labor shortages, erratic rainfall, and rising costs threatened her family’s farmland in Odisha, India, Shanti made a bold choice. She left a stable town business to protect her community’s lifeline—rice farming.

Refusing to give up, Shanti became an inspiration for her people. She adopted Direct Seeded Rice (DSR), reducing labor dependency and water usage. Traditional rice farming consumes 4,000–5,000 liters of water per kilogram, but DSR cuts water use by 40%, lowers methane emissions by 45%, and enhances soil health—securing livelihoods in the process.

With 150 million smallholder farmers worldwide, DSR has the potential to make rice cultivation sustainable. At Bayer, we are promoting water-smart agricultural practices to help farmers grow more and restore more.

"I met my younger self over a Cortado this morning – my go-to coffee.

She arrived early and I was five minutes late.
She longed to belong, unsure of her place.

I told her that self-doubt fades and the right people will always find her.
She feared failure.

I reassured her that failing forward is just another step toward growth.
She thought silence meant loneliness.

I told her it’s where confidence takes root.
We talked about my 10-year journey in Strategic Corporate Communication.

About the love I receive from my family and the little mini-me who fills my days with joy.
We hugged. It was comforting for us both.

I hope we meet for coffee again soon.

"Populations in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) are particularly vulnerable to the health effects of climate change due to their geographical location, low socioeconomic status and weak healthcare infrastructure. In this context, climate change disproportionately affects women and girls, exacerbating existing gender inequalities and posing distinct health risks.  

As a leader in women’s health and agriculture, we at Bayer are supporting women to give them access to the tools and knowledge to improve their health, rights and economic status. In doing so, we can also lay the foundation for and support future generations of women.

"A Tradition of Movement: Why Staying Active Matters at Work

Did you know? Long before ""work-life balance"" became a buzzword, Bayer employees were already taking care of their health through movement. This picture from 1903 shows our colleagues in Leverkusen engaging in gymnastics – because even back then, staying active at work was key to feeling good and performing well. Just a year later, the TUS 04 sports club was founded, kicking off a long tradition of company sports at Bayer.

Today, we know more than ever about the connection between physical activity, mental resilience, and workplace performance. Regular movement helps reduce stress, increase concentration, and boost energy levels – things we all need in our daily work lives. That’s why we provide employees with MyHealth, a platform that offers personalized wellbeing resources and energy workshops that focus on sustainable energy management.

Taking care of yourself isn’t just about productivity – it’s about feeling good in and outside of work. So whether it’s a midday stretch, a lunchtime run, or an after-work sports session with colleagues, movement matters!

"Did you know some of the world’s most important crops like corn, wheat, and rice require nitrogen fertilizers to become food for our growing population? That's because the microbes on their roots can’t turn the nitrogen in the air into a form they can absorb. Plants like soy, however, have microbes that can do just that. 

What if we could give other crops that same ability? It could save farmers time and money, plus help our planet by conserving precious resources. That’s the future of agriculture, and our team is working to make it a reality. 

Together with Ginkgo Bioworks we’re designing microbes to help plants like corn, wheat, and rice fix environmental nitrogen, rather than rely on synthetic fertilizers.

Recently, Caroline Meledo, Head, Sustainability Integration & Inclusive Growth, Bayer Consumer Health, and sandeep verma, Country Head, India, Bangladesh & Sri Lanka, Bayer Consumer Health, participated in a discussion on one of India’s largest news channels, NDTV 24x7 in the show titled ""One Nation, 100% Nutrition"".

"What you might think is just dirt is actually soil—and that distinction matters! Climate change is largely driven by excess greenhouse gases, with carbon being a major contributor. But did you know this same carbon can become a valuable resource for a farmer’s soil?

In agriculture, cover crops are off-season plants that protect soil from erosion and pull carbon underground, enhancing its health. Traditionally, their benefits ended there, as they weren’t harvested or sold.

CoverCress™ changes this by providing all the benefits of traditional cover crops while also being harvestable for renewable fuel with ultra-low carbon emissions. It’s a win-win for farmers and nature, turning sustainable practices into smart business opportunities.

“O Brasil é amplamente conhecido como um dos países mais hostis para a população transgênero. No âmbito social e organizacional, as barreiras estruturais movidas pelo preconceito e pela discriminação são presentes.  
 
A escassez de oferta profissional para homens trans, mulheres trans e travestis resulta em dados alarmantes de subemprego ou condições indignas de trabalho. Ações afirmativas que promovem a empregabilidade, em muitos casos a preparação profissional dessa população, são de extrema importância social e estrutural.  
 
A diminuição da desigualdade e a constante quebra de preconceito são engrenagens contínuas que podem e devem ser protagonizadas pelas companhias, gerando assim impacto e transformação expressiva. 

O preparo de equipes e liderança é igualmente relevante, pois a pessoa a ser contratada necessitará de ambiente seguro, em todos os aspectos, para performar e conduzir uma trajetória digna de trabalho.”

"📢 Exciting news from World Economic Forum in Davos! 🌎 

Together with the Bayer Foundation and PULA we announce a partnership to provide insurance for 10 million smallholder farmers 

According to the FAO, in 2023, around 2.33 billion people globally faced food insecurity, with smallholder farmers playing a crucial role by producing over half of the food consumed in low- and middle-income countries. However, climate change poses significant challenges to their livelihoods. To address this, the PULA Foundation has created scalable, data-driven agricultural insurance solutions that mitigate risks from extreme weather events such as droughts and floods, ensuring that farmers receive financial compensation. This support enables them to recover, reinvest, and build resilience against climate uncertainties.

By 2030, the Bayer Foundation’s grant for insurance premium support—backed by a donation from Bayer | Crop Science — will unlock potential insurance coverage of 127 million US dollars for 10 million farmers working with national governments in Bangladesh, Pakistan, Malawi, Ghana, Nigeria, Kenya, and Mali.

"🌾 Can we grow more with less? Yes! And one way is with agricultural practices like Direct Seeded Rice. 

India is home to the world’s largest rice acreage. It is also at the heart of a global challenge: climate change and its impact on global food security.  

With over half the world's population relying on rice as a daily food staple, regenerative agricultural practices like Direct Seeded Rice (DSR) are crucial. Here’s why: 

     🌏 Climate impact → Flooded paddy fields, traditionally used to grow rice, not only use a lot of water, they also emit 12% of global methane emissions—a potent greenhouse gas. But by removing the need for flooded fields, DSR conserves water, reduces emissions, and protects the soil. 

     🍚 Food security → With the global population expected to increase to 10 billion by 2050, it is estimated that rice production will need to increase by 35% to meet demand. Moving from conventional transplanted rice cultivation practices to a more economically viable and sustainable solution like DSR, is helping to address that need.

Shanti, a farmer in India has already seen the positive impacts of the DSR system – not only for herself and her family, but also for the community of smallholder farmers in her region.  
 
At Bayer, we’re here to help rice farmers like Shanti transition to more regenerative agricultural practices. We see partnerships as key to equipping farmers with agronomic advice, climate-resilient hybrids, crop protection, digital tools and more to enable farmers to produce more and restore more at the same time. 

Hand-in-hand with farmers, we aim to meet the rising demand for rice while safeguarding our planet’s future.

It is a multifaceted problem that requires a collective effort, from farmers, factories, restaurants, governments, and all actors of the food values chain to consumers. 

Our researchers are innovating to help tackle this problem: Digital farming technologies such as soil sensors and satellites are helping to preemptively diagnose and treat various threats to crops before they take hold - helping prevent crop loss from the start. In addition, we offer farmers new varieties of seeds, along with crop protection tools, to help more crops make it off the farm.

The session will feature Mojib Latif, Senior Professor at GEOMAR Helmholtz-Zentrum für Ozeanforschung Kiel and President of the German Association Club of Rome, along with Matthias Berninger, EVP of Public Affairs, Sustainability & Safety at Bayer.

Despite decades of global climate summits, including the recent COP29 in Baku, Azerbaijan, emissions continue to rise, and scientists warn that the Paris Agreement's 1.5-degree target is effectively out of reach. What does this mean for our approach to climate action? What changes are needed in global governance and cooperation?

"In India, while most farmers are already practicing regenerative agriculture with a primary focus on improving soil health, a significant knowledge gap hinders the broader adoption of these practices. According to the Survey, many farmers still lack awareness of the term ""regenerative agriculture,"" which is limiting the broader adoption of these sustainable practices.

At Bayer, we believe that bridging this knowledge gap is key to empowering farmers and accelerating the transition to sustainable farming practices. Through innovations like Direct Seeded Rice (DSR), IoT tools, and drip irrigation, we are equipping farmers with practical, scalable solutions to optimize their practices and enhance soil health.

"For modern farming, data is the new tractor. 🚜

Farming has always been more than just soil, seeds, and seasons. It’s about decisions, the kind that can drive productivity. Today, most of these decisions are powered by data and digital tools.

On Syngenta’s Farm of the Future in Illinois, algorithms help guide seed selection and drones hover over fields.

“The future will see farmers using collections of autonomous tractors with preloaded inputs and an on-board agronomy brain making real-time optimized decisions. These tractors could then be integrated into a wider network of sensors, making farms more connected, more productive and more sustainable.” ~ Feroz Sheikh, Chief Information and Digital Officer, Syngenta Group

"Sustainability starts in the soil. We’ve partnered with PepsiCo to support farmers in Argentina who are adopting regenerative and traceable agricultural practices—and it’s making a difference 🌱

Farmers in our program earn 1-2% above the domestic market price for sunflower grain, which ultimately contributes to the French fries you love 🍟

In year one, farmers using verified regenerative practices across Argentina supplied 4,000 tons of sunflower oil to PepsiCo. And this is just the beginning—we aim to expand the hectares in this initiative by at least 25%.

This collaboration aligns with our larger commitment: advancing regenerative agriculture across 50 million hectares by 2030 to improve soil health, biodiversity, and climate resilience—while ensuring farmers are supported.

"Drought is increasingly a devastating reality for many farmers as extreme weather conditions intensify and soil water evaporates.

Global temperatures hit a record high in July 2024, and droughts occurred roughly once a week between August 2023 and July 2024, according to the European Commission. ☀️

Over a three-year study, our scientists tested how wheat withstood drought and found that wheat treated with crop protection products retained more water than untreated crops, and the grain yields were 5.2% higher.

“As crops are better able to manage and conserve water, this ensures a more efficient plant that can maintain longer periods of active energy production that translates into higher yields,” said Tyler Harp, Fungicide Technical Manager at Syngenta Crop Protection.

Imagine if we could change that. What if every home, workplace, school and community became a place of empathy—a space where conversations about diabetes and mental health weren’t just accepted,  but encouraged?

The shift starts with us. By challenging biases, fostering awareness and embracing open dialogue, we can create a world where stigma fades and understanding grows.

"Too many liver diseases are discovered too late when symptoms appear and curative options narrow.

What if we could detect liver disease early, even in places where advanced imaging isn’t available?

With tools like blood-based algorithms, digital risk stratification, and integrated patient management, clinicians can screen, monitor, and manage high-risk patients more effectively — giving patients more options and more control over their health.

A pilot in Shanghai’s Jia Ding district screened 12,000 individuals at high risk of liver cancer with innovative diagnostics, achieving early-stage diagnosis rate of >85%, far exceeding the national rate of <30%.

Imagine the possibilities when people catch diseases earlier on, removing the should-haves that come after diagnoses.

"Sometimes the most impactful innovations in healthcare aren’t about new tests — they’re about deriving novel insights from the ones we already perform every day.

Take chronic kidney disease: routine blood and urine tests are run worldwide, yet often reveal abnormalities only after significant damage has already occurred.

But combined with AI and automation — analyzing patterns from thousands of patients' demographics (age + sex) and clinical parameters — these same results can flag patients at high risks much earlier. Clinicians can act before complications arise.This is the promise of digital health: turning the ordinary into the extraordinary. Not by replacing clinicians, but by giving them innovative tools to anticipate risks, prevent diseases and provide personalized care.

The disease affects their central nervous system, depriving them of their ability to perform simple everyday tasks like walking, cooking, bathing or the strength to hold a child. Their day-to-day struggle remains hidden and performing everyday tasks can feel like scaling an invisible mountain. 

#RochePharmaIndia in collaboration with the Multiple Sclerosis Society of India (MSSI) presents #WalkInMyShoes - a public health awareness initiative to highlight the often invisible struggles of individuals living with this life-limiting neurological condition. It reflects our deep commitment to raising awareness, breaking down stigma, and advocating for those whose struggles often go unheard and unseen. 

The #WalkInMyShoes simulation zones will re-create a sensory experience of four of the most commonly occurring MS symptoms - loss of balance, motor impairment, blurry vision and loss of sensitivity to spark conversations, build a sense of community and bring to the forefront the everyday challenges that MS patients face. 

We invite you to walk with us and experience #EmpathyInAction at the following locations:

"In the United States alone, research shows 1 in 5 patients with limited access to transportation miss critical medical appointments. Likewise, our research published in The Lancet, highlights that for rural patients with retinal disease, lack of transport is a major barrier.

That's why we are running programmes to remove transportation as a barrier to accessing health. In the U.S. and Brazil, we are collaborating with Uber Health to provide reliable transportation to access both clinical trials and regular care, while in Canada we have developed transportation guides to help people navigate their journeys.

"""I am emotionally exhausted. Seeing a production that was in its prime full of reeds, trees, disturbed earth... it is devastating.”

Valencian grower Luis Julián Pérez is one of thousands of growers rebuilding their farms after the worst flash flooding Spain had seen in decades. These photos show just some examples of the impact across the country. Pérez’s vineyards, almonds, and olive crops were battered by the rain that overturned trellises and washed away his precious topsoil.

But the agriculture community, including the Syngenta team, has rallied together to support growers like him. Together, we’re helping him tackle the challenges that will remain after the cleanup: heightened pest pressures, degraded soil quality, and reduced yields.

A key focus was addressing the growing NCD burden in low and middle-income countries – a priority for Novartis. Vas highlighted that through collaboration with civil society, governments, and local providers, we can harness emerging technologies and innovative treatments to improve early detection and health outcomes in underserved communities.

Drawing parallels to the global alliance for vaccines, Vas called for a ""global fund for NCDs"" to accelerate healthcare innovation at scale. Thank you to the leaders who joined this panel: Magdalena Skipper (Editor-in-Chief, Nature), Pedro Sánchez (Prime Minister of Spain), Sania Nishtar (CEO, Gavi), Peter Sands (Executive Director, Global Fund), and Professor Klaus Schwab (Founder and Executive Chairman of the World Economic Forum) for hosting this important discussion. #GlobalHealth #Davos2025 #access #innovation #technology

#BASFcoatings #WinningWays #Coatings #InvestorRelations"
"BASF and funds managed by global investment firm Carlyle (NASDAQ: CG), in partnership with Qatar Investment Authority (QIA), have entered into a binding agreement relating to BASF’s automotive OEM coatings, automotive refinish coatings, and surface treatment businesses (“BASF Coatings”).



The enterprise value of the transaction amounts to €7.7 billion. Subject to customary regulatory approvals, the transaction is expected to close in Q2 2026. This transaction, together with the already closed divestiture of the decorative paints business, value BASF’s entire Coatings division at an enterprise value of €8.7 billion and an implied 2024 EV/EBITDA multiple before special items of approx. 13x. This represents a significant step in unlocking the value of BASF’s standalone businesses, as the company swiftly executes its Winning Ways strategy. BASF will also reinvest in the coatings business holding a 40% equity stake and will receive pre-tax cash proceeds of approx. €5.8 billion at closing of the transaction.



Working closely alongside management, Carlyle will support the future growth of the business through investing in its commercial capabilities, innovation pipeline, and organizational structure to enhance customer focus. Carlyle will leverage its strong track record and extensive experience in successful carve-outs of industrial and chemical assets, following previous investments in Axalta, Atotech, and Nouryon.

"Congratulations to Susumu Kitagawa, Richard Robson, and Omar M. Yaghi for receiving the 2025 #NobelPrize in #Chemistry for their pioneering work on metal–organic frameworks (#MOFs).

The scientists developed a new kind of molecular structure that combines metals and organic molecules. The metals act as nodes, linked by organic molecules containing carbon, forming large, empty spaces inside the frameworks through which gases and other materials can flow.

#MOFs can be used to harvest water from desert air, capture carbon dioxide, store toxic gases, or catalyze chemical reactions—therefore revolutionizing #science and #industry.

Did you know? Omar Yaghi is co-founder of the California Research Alliance (CARA) by BASF.

#BASF is also proud to be the first company to produce MOFs for CO₂ capture on an industrial scale, offering customized solutions for a wide range of industries and applications worldwide.

"We’re proud to share the new “OECD Best Practice Guide on Chemical Data Sharing Between Companies”.
BASF welcomed and proactively helped draft this guidance together with industry peers and stakeholders. It advances practical, fair and transparent data‑sharing—essential to protect human health and the environment, avoid duplicate studies (including animal testing), and enable consistent regulatory submissions worldwide.
Aligned with the Internation Council of Chemical Associations’ (ICCA’s) ambition for transparency under the new political “Global Framework on Chemicals”, the guide supports broader access to reliable safety data and promotes cross-fertilization of regulatory practice across regions. Greater transparency will help regulators, industry and civil society make better‑informed decisions, reduce unnecessary testing, and foster trust among stakeholders.
As part of ICCA, BASF members played an active role in developing the guide in cooperation with associations, companies and other interested parties. This collaborative effort demonstrates the value of multi‑stakeholder engagement to tackle practical challenges—finding who owns data, clarifying rights to use or refer to studies, and agreeing fair compensation mechanisms.

"🌍 Sărbătorim Ziua Mondială a Curățeniei cu Suflet și Chimie 🧼💚
Ieri, pe 24 septembrie, un grup de voluntari entuziaști din cadrul BTC Europe din BASF România s-a reunit pentru o inițiativă specială dedicată Zilei Mondiale a Curățeniei — adaptată cu grijă pentru comunitatea noastră locală.
Am vizitat un centru de zi pentru persoane vârstnice din București, parte a Asociația Niciodată Singur - Prietenii Vârstnicilor, unde am petrecut momente pline de sens alături de rezidenți. Am adus câteva bunătăți pentru a îndulci timpul petrecut împreună, am împărtășit povești și am vorbit despre rolul BASF în îmbunătățirea calității vieții de-a lungul generațiilor.
Discuțiile noastre au atins subiecte precum sustenabilitatea, puterea chimiei și modul în care ingredientele active BASF simplifică treburile casnice de zi cu zi. Ca gest de apreciere, am oferit produse românești formulate cu ingrediente BASF — o modalitate de a conecta inovația cu grija.
Pentru a încheia vizita, ne-am suflecat mânecile și am ajutat la curățarea grădinii exterioare a centrului, lăsând-o proaspătă și pregătită pentru toamnă.
💬 A fost o zi plină de zâmbete, povești și scop comun — o adevărată reflecție a modului în care voluntariatul și știința pot lucra împreună pentru a face o diferență.

🌍 Celebrating World Cleanup Day with Heart and Chemistry 🧼💚
Yesterday, on 24 September, at the initiative of BTC Europe, a group of volunteers from BASF Romania came together for a special initiative to mark World Cleanup Day — tailored with care for our local community.
We visited a day center for seniors in Bucharest, part of the Asociația Niciodată Singur - Prietenii Vârstnicilor, where we spent meaningful time with the residents during their daily workshop. We brought along some treats to sweeten and brighten the day, shared stories, and talked about BASF’s role in improving quality of life with its innovative products across generations.
Our conversations touched on sustainability, the power of chemistry, and how BASF’s active ingredients simplify everyday chores. As a thoughtful gesture, we gifted Romanian-made products formulated with BASF ingredients — a small way to connect innovation with care.
To wrap up the visit, we rolled up our sleeves and helped clean the center’s outdoor garden, leaving it refreshed and ready for autumn.
💬 It was a day filled with smiles, stories, and shared purpose — a true reflection of how volunteering and science can come together to make a difference.

"Attributed biogenic carbon is a vital component in many chemicals and derived products. Our goal is to provide it sustainably, ensuring the long-term success of the green transformation of the chemical industry. 

At BASF, we are committed to driving thought leadership in the bioeconomy space. Our recently released Perspective Chapter, titled ""The Growing Importance of Bio-Attributed Products in Reducing Greenhouse Gas Emissions,"" co-authored by esteemed sustainability thought leaders Dr. Ivana Krkljuš, Christian Krueger and Peter Saling, serves as a significant contribution to this discourse. It underscores BASF's commitment to sourcing renewable feedstocks, to reduce the uptake of fossil resources and to thereby consequently mitigate the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions caused by purchased feedstocks. This book chapter is the first-of-its-kind, emphasizing the significance of bio-attributed products and its contribution to the reduction of Scope 3 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. 

BASF is offering a range of bio-derived (bio-based and bio-attributed) products to its customers. Bio-based products are derived from renewable materials such as vegetable oils, fats, grains, sugar, and wood, and used for products supplied to cosmetics industry, for pharmaceuticals, etc. Our range of bio-attributed products allows the attribution of the renewable feedstock via a mass balance approach to the products where our customers are willing to pay the premium that is needed. Using interlinked production facilities and highly optimized processes ensures that all materials are used in the most (cost) efficient way whilst maintaining product quality and performance. We work together with recognized sustainability certification systems such as ISCC PLUS or REDcert2 to ensure transparency and accountability.  

Key concepts discussed in the book chapter:
·      Insights on the role of bio-attributed products and their importance in greenhouse gas emissions reduction.  
·      The concept of Mass Balance Chain of Custody (MB CoC) and its attribution principles easily explained. 
·      The way of combining the MB CoC for material and energy tracking in supply chains and the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA)methodology.
·      Driving Change via expansion of bio-attributed products, the concept that allows to substitute large quantities of fossil raw materials and continuously increase the shares of renewable raw materials. 

We invite you to explore this important work and consider benefits of bio-attributed products in meeting self-defined GHG emission targets and regulatory-imposed sustainability targets.

"At BASF, we're not just reducing carbon emissions, we're also redefining resource consumption. By harnessing organic carbon from renewable materials, we are driving the transition away from fossil resources. Our transformation centers on defossilization instead of decarbonization alone, which often involves reducing carbon emissions without addressing the source of the carbon itself. By defossilizing, we can fundamentally change the raw materials used in our production, ensuring a more sustainable and circular economy.
Our newly established BASF Renewable Carbon (BReC) unit is at the forefront of this transformation, exploring diverse renewable feedstocks and collaborating with suppliers and partners to redefine value chains.
In our kickoff article, we delve into the transformative power of renewable carbon and its role in enabling the green transformation – of our customers and of BASF. Discover how diverse organic sources can serve as alternative raw materials, facilitating the production of biobased and biomass-balanced products enabling low and Zero product carbon footprints - without compromising on quality or performance.

"Noch 21 Tage bis zur Bundestagswahl. Aus unserer Serie zu Prioritäten der Wahl widmen wir uns heute einer nachhaltigen Chemikalienpolitik.

Chemikalienpolitik wirkt sich auf die gesamte industrielle Wertschöpfung und somit auf die Herstellung aller Produkte des täglichen Lebens aus. Wie muss eine moderne und pragmatische Chemikalienpolitik gestaltet sein, um dies zu berücksichtigen und um die Industrie bei der Herausforderung, Umweltschutz und Wettbewerbsfähigkeit zu vereinen, zu unterstützen?


Effiziente Planungs-, Genehmigungs- und Umsetzungsprozesse sind essenziell. Ein schnell umgesetzter „Deutschland-Pakt“ und eine eins-zu-eins umgesetzte Europäische Industrieemissionsrichtlinie geben Unternehmen die notwendige Sicherheit, um Innovationen schneller voranzutreiben. Dieser Ansatz verbindet ökonomische Stärke mit ökologischer Verantwortung.


Die REACH-Verordnung sollte sehr gezielt angepasst werden. Statt neuer umfassender Regularien sollte der Fokus auf wissenschaftlich fundierten und zielgerichteten Vereinfachungen liegen, die praktikabel und klar umsetzbar sind.


Es bedarf eines wissenschaftlichen, risikobasierten, aber auch verlässlichen Förderrahmens für die Entwicklung sicherer und nachhaltiger Chemikalien, die den Weg für zukunftsfähige Lösungen ebnen.


Spezielle Stoffe wie PFAS, die für industrielle Anwendungen essentiell sind, brauchen dafür langfristige Genehmigungen, wenn keine Ersatzstoffe verfügbar sind. Eine ausgewogene Regulierung, die sowohl wirtschaftliche Anforderungen als auch ökologische Notwendigkeiten berücksichtigt, kann hier eine Brücke schlagen.

Robin Pocornie made this experience with a facial recognition software at her university. It was unable to recognize students with darker skin tones. As a result, she faced issues during her exams, unlike her white peers.

"BASF officially opened its new Catalyst Development and Solids Processing Center in Ludwigshafen, Germany. This research facility will serve as a hub for pilot-scale synthesis of chemical catalysts, enabling BASF to offer its global customers faster access to innovative technologies. This pilot plant will also be of central importance for the development of new solids processing technologies.

Catalysts play a key role in industrial chemistry. More than 80 percent of all chemical products come into contact with a catalyst at least once during their production. Catalysts reduce the energy demand and the amount of undesired by-products. Thereby, they minimize raw material consumption and shrink the carbon footprint of products. Catalysts are used in many areas, including the chemical and petrochemical industries, as well as in innovative processes
essential for the green transformation. BASF not only develops catalyst and process technologies for its customers worldwide, it also uses them in its own manufacturing plants.

"Sustainable oil supply: How BASF's Partnership with INOCAS Drives Renewable Feedstock
We are advancing our sustainability portfolio by partnering with Innovative Oil and Carbon Solutions (INOCAS) to develop the cultivation of Macaúba, a native tree in Brazil, and to process its pulp and kernel oil. The long-term Supplier Finance Agreement between BASF and INOCAS includes an offtake agreement for a reliable and sustainable supply of Macaúba Kernel Oil (MKO) and Macaúba Pulp Oil (MPO). The partnership will enable us to further expand our renewable-based portfolio. ""Macaúba"", a native Brazilian tree (Acrocomia aculeata), is known for its extensive dispersion across Brazil and its resilience in dry conditions and degraded soil. 
Since 2015, INOCAS has developed, implemented and refined an innovative model to cultivate Macaúba trees on degraded pastureland, and to improve soil quality and productivity. Based on its strong intellectual property and experience, INOCAS aims to plant at least 50,000 hectares of Macaúba in partnership with smallholder farmers by 2030. This system supports regenerative agriculture by combining forestry and livestock farming without an additional land use change. It has positive impacts on soil quality, erosion control and biodiversity. Agricultural partnerships with smallholder farmers aim at improving livelihoods for their families. 
The partnership also includes financing of INOCAS’ plans to develop the Macaúba oil production in Brazil on an industrial scale. The project will generate significant benefits in environmental, social, and economic terms. These efforts align seamlessly with BASF’s commitment to sustainability and reinforce our dedication to reduce the consumption of fossil-based feedstock and replace it with alternative raw materials. As demand for sustainable products continues to grow, our ability to integrate MKO and MPO into our value chains is another essential stepstone for supporting our customers' green transformations.

"The earth moved. Buildings shook. On March 28, a 7.7-7.9 magnitude earthquake struck Myanmar, the most powerful since 1912 and the second deadliest since the 1930s. The impact was so large that neighboring countries China, Thailand, and even distant Vietnam received structural damage. For many residents, this was their first time encountering a natural disaster on this scale.

To aid these communities where we operate, Corteva Asia Pacific swiftly mobilized to support relief efforts. The Thailand team collaborated with Rise Against Hunger, the Rotary Club of Shwe Bangkok, and Disaster Aid Thailand to organize a dedicated team of 70 Corteva employees and 50 Rotarians to pack 100,000 meals for those in need.

This impactful initiative, completed on April 23, saw our teams contribute a combined 600 volunteer hours towards relief efforts. We commend the Thailand team and all those involved for living our Corteva values - their swift action and generous contributions during this critical time as well as powerful display of teamwork and compassion have made a huge difference for the affected communities.

In moments like these, we are reminded of our shared humanity and the importance of coming together. Reflecting on the strength that our teams and partners showed, we are inspired to continue making a positive impact in the world that goes beyond business transactions and borders."

"Yogita Patidar, an Indian farmer, had always been closely connected to farming life, managing household responsibilities, supporting agricultural work, and sewing to supplement her family’s income. But her involvement took on a new shape when she became a promoter with the Farmer Producer Organization (FPO) in Madhya Pradesh, India.

With focus and persistence, she began mobilizing farming groups and encouraging them to join the FPO as shareholders. In just three months, she helped onboard nearly 300 members, building momentum for a stronger collective.

Training from Corteva Agriscience and Samunnati further sharpened her skills. From ensuring access to quality seeds to launching a program that offered affordable animal feed, Yogita played a key role in the FPO’s Rs. 3 million turnovers in its first year.

Her consistent efforts have helped build a more connected and resilient farming community.

"“I was born and raised in the city, so my experiences were initially confined to an urban environment. However, upon entering the agricultural sector, I’ve had the opportunity to forge deeper connections with farmers and the land, significantly broadening my horizons. Engaging with rural communities has provided me with invaluable opportunities for personal and professional growth, greatly enriching my life.”

Since joining Corteva in 2006 straight out of college, Ariel has spent nearly a decade diving into the agricultural world. Her journey has been all about figuring out how to make things work better – whether it's streamlining operations, building a rock-solid team, or really listening to what farmers need. By helping them to boost productivity and unlock new opportunities, she's not only seen their businesses grow but also found her own purpose in creating real, lasting impact.

“One of my personal interests is to gain a deeper understanding of individuals and their decision-making process. Listening to farmers’ concerns, comprehending their pain points, and collaborating with them to find solutions for a successful plating season is one of my favourite aspects of our business in agriculture. It’s not just a means to realize my personal value, but also an essential contribution to society.”

“In Chinese there is a saying: 见自己，见天地，见众生。Loosely translated, it means ‘to understand the self, to understand the world, and to understand existence. Agriculture serves as an avenue for us to experience this firsthand: in tilling the soil, we cultivate patience, resilience, and interdependence (the self). The earth itself is the medium through which we practice this, with its cyclical seasons that provide a sense of rhythm (the world). Farming then becomes a journey of self-discovery, worldly wisdom, and universal empathy – the quintessence of ‘the meaningful existence’.”"

For Brady Mouzin, whose family has grown cantaloupes for nearly 90 years, the global market’s shift to long shelf-life varieties represented a challenge.

"Do you know what's almost invisible, gives headaches even to the most experienced farmers, and hides in nearly every soil?

The plant-parasitic nematode. 🪱

These stealthy invaders are found across agricultural heartlands worldwide, causing $80–118 billion in crop losses each year. Beyond direct damage, they open the door to a range of secondary diseases — silently threatening yields from below ground.

That’s why, in 2022, we introduced TYMIRIUM® technology in South America — empowering farmers with a new line of defense that works from seed to young plant, protecting below-ground roots and above-ground potential.

With over 8,000 trials across more than 100 crops in 60+ countries, this innovation is setting a new benchmark for sustainable crop protection — helping farmers secure stronger establishment, healthier plants, and higher yields.

"Artificial Intelligence (AI) has incredible potential in agriculture, and we’re excited to continue expanding how we’re using this technology for the benefit of farmers and growers around the world.

Syngenta Vegetable Seeds and Heritable Agriculture announced today a collaboration to harness AI technology to determine the best vegetable varieties to offer growers.

Heritable, a spinoff from Google parent Alphabet’s innovation lab, will leverage historical data on geographical conditions and crop trialing with the goal of better predicting the best-performing commercial varieties in different regions to help Syngenta ensure growers have the best possible product offering.

Traditionally, seed companies spend countless hours evaluating data, trialing different varieties and sourcing feedback from growers and the value chain. While these inputs are still important, technology now offers a way to accelerate these decisions and help growers plant the right seed for success.

If successful, this collaboration will be able to predict scalable vegetable seed performance for a grower anywhere in the world, up to a 10-meter resolution.

"The Western corn rootworm is on the move — and it’s hungry. 🐛

Native to North America, this invasive leaf beetle is now spreading across Europe, threatening food security and farm livelihoods.

This invasive pest has spread across the US Corn Belt, costing US farmers up to $1 billion annually (USDA). 🌽

“The spread of corn rootworm is restricted by cold weather conditions in the winter, but with global warming its range is likely to continue to expand,” ~ Russell Slater, Global Technical Manager, Syngenta.

Why it’s such a problem:

Its larvae tunnel into corn (maize) roots, which:

- Reduce the plant’s ability to absorb water & nutrients
- Make crops more vulnerable to disease

What can be done?

Our scientists recommend an integrated pest management approach, including:

✅ Deep tillage

✅ Early planting

✅ Crop rotation

✅ Corn hybrids - where available - with genetic, biotech traits

Raising awareness is the first step — action is the next. 💪

"Ms. Poonam, a 32-year-old from a remote village in India, dreamt of making a difference. 

Completing her middle school education, she went on to juggle roles as a homemaker and owner of a stitching shop. Her path changed in 2022 when she joined a Farmer Producer Organization (FPO). The FPO enabled women with training in DSR farming, Mahua (commonly known as butter tree) fruits and flowers processing & pea cultivation.

Engaging in extensive outreach, she visited surrounding villages, conducted meetings and created awareness among local farmers on the benefits of joining the FPO. Her efforts resulted in the successful integration and empowerment of over 600 female farmers, fostering a sense of community and teamwork. 

As her influence grew, Poonam actively engaged with local authorities, including the district CEO and District Magistrate. Her dedication made her a recognized advocate for women's empowerment and agriculture within the district.

"Women in India hold a vital position within the agricultural sector, and their contributions extend beyond farming and labor; they are increasingly engaging in research and emerging as entrepreneurs. While there are numerous compelling stories from every village, town, and district, here's one exemplary woman whose determination led to significant transformation. 

Rani Devi from Pandpa village in Bihar, married at a young age. Constrained by domestic responsibilities, her aspirations were hindered by societal resistance. Nevertheless, she seized the opportunity to join us and Professional Assistance for Development Action (PRADAN) as a Community Resource Person (CRP), where she trained farmers in the Direct Sowing of Rice (DSR). With this knowledge and backing, Rani cultivated DSR on 0.6 acres, achieving an impressive yield of 14.5 quintals, significantly surpassing traditional methods. 

This accomplishment provided her with additional income and altered her family's perception. Her husband began to share household responsibilities and acknowledged her contributions. Presently, Rani is a passionate advocate for DSR and women's empowerment, guiding more than 100 farmers across districts. We take great pride in Rani and wholeheartedly support her ongoing journey.

"Saroj Devi, a millet farmer from Bharatpur, was married at the age of 18. While she actively assisted her husband in farming, she aspired to increase her family's income to cover her daughter's coaching fees and her son's college education. To pursue this goal, she participated in our women farmer training program. 

During this program, she learned to enhance her farming practices and incorporate hybrid millet, which offers better resistance to drought, pests, and diseases. She chose to cultivate hybrid millet on 20 acres of her 40-acre land. As a result, Saroj significantly reduced her pesticide and fertilizer costs, improved the quality of her millet, achieved higher market prices, increased her crop yield, and augmented her family income. 

Today, she supports her family and promotes hybrid millet farming, highlighting its advantages, such as higher yields, cost savings, and financial security, while encouraging fellow farmers to adopt these practices.

"Which elements from the periodic table can make our electronics smarter by enhancing their speed and performance? 

High-k gate oxides, like hafnium, are the answer! These materials have been effectively used for some time in the dielectric layers of transistors, allowing for high switching speeds with slightly thicker films. This means less leakage and lower power consumption in our logic circuits.

The result? Improved performance, reduced energy waste, and lower operating costs—all while being kinder to the environment!"

"From the history vault
 
Emanuel Merck was passionate about alkaloids, which makes sense for someone who ran the Merck pharmacy in the early 19th century. Alkaloids were —and continue to be — commonplace on pharmacy shelves.
 
He started producing kits of alkaloids and alkaloid salts with high purities — like the one seen here — to help standardize what doctors, pharmacists and chemists used to conduct experiments. This helped transition pharmacies from a “craft-based” approach into a robust scientific field."
"Quiz Time! A revolutionary new treatment called mRNA helped billions of patients during the pandemic. Today, its aim is to change the way we treat a range of diseases that were once thought to be incurable. Despite its wide application, producing and shipping mRNAs is not easy."

"🌍Zdrowie psychiczne młodych ludzi – fundament przyszłości społeczeństwa 🌟

Zdaniem ekspertów zaproszonych do międzynarodowego projektu FutURe, zainicjowanego przez naszą firmę, zdrowie psychiczne młodych ludzi to nie luksus, lecz fundament bezpiecznej przyszłości całego społeczeństwa. 🧠💪

Podczas debaty „Zdrowie emocjonalne i dobre samopoczucie w niepewnych czasach” – z udziałem m.in. Phil Krzyzek – przedstawiono rekomendacje i wizję systemowych zmian na rzecz bardziej inkluzywnej przyszłości.

💡Kluczowe obszary wymagające natychmiastowej uwagi:

🏫 brak dostępu do wsparcia psychologicznego w wielu polskich szkołach,
📚 nierówne szanse edukacyjne, 
💰 wysokie koszty opieki psychologicznej, które dla wielu rodzin pozostają barierą. 

Eksperci nie tylko diagnozowali problemy, ale także zaproponowali konkretne rozwiązania:

🔹wprowadzenie psychoedukacji do programów nauczania,
🔹zwiększenie liczby specjalistów w szkołach, 
🔹stworzenie systemów ułatwiających młodym ludziom dostęp do wsparcia psychologicznego – także bez zgody rodziców w sytuacjach kryzysowych. 

🤝Kluczową rolę w procesie zmian odgrywa współpraca międzysektorowa, w tym zaangażowanie NGO-sów i firm prywatnych.

💬 „Jestem przekonany, że biznes może być liderem pozytywnych zmian. Działania na rzecz zdrowia psychicznego młodych ludzi to kluczowy element społecznej odpowiedzialności, który powinien być priorytetem dla firm na całym świecie. Poprzez współpracę międzysektorową i działania na rzecz inkluzywności możemy stworzyć system, w którym każdy z nas będzie miał szansę na rozwój i poczucie bezpieczeństwa” – podsumował spotkanie Phil Krzyzek

"Our New CSR Initiative in India: Maternal Vaccination Awareness & Sensitization Program

The program aims to enhance maternal vaccination awareness in communities by building healthcare workers' capacity to address vaccine hesitancy and strengthen community vaccine confidence. 

Our CSR partner BharatCares recently conducted the pilot launch in Kolkata in collaboration with the Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC). The event featured 70+ Front Line Workers who will drive this initiative along with distinguished guests including Dr. Tapan Kumar Mukherjee (Honorary Health Advisor) and Dr. Ronita Sengupta (Chief Municipal Health Officer). Leaders from Sanofi in India including Vinifer Gandhi, Nitya Padmanabhan and Dr. Kavita Chaudhari (She/Her), attended the event virtually. As the next stage, the initiative will also be launched in Pune.

In India, approximately 30 million women experience pregnancy and 27 million have live births annually*. While maternal immunization can protect both mothers and babies from vaccine-preventable diseases, a significant awareness gap exists, especially in rural and lower socio-economic communities. Vaccine hesitancy may also be due to low perceived risk of vaccine-preventable diseases, along with misconceptions and myths about vaccination.

Through initiatives like the Maternal Vaccination Awareness & Sensitization Program, we're taking on some of the world's most pressing challenges to improve health outcomes for vulnerable communities. When we empower healthcare workers and educate communities, we create lasting change - one mother, one baby, one family at a time.

"Alka used to fall sick very often as a child. She was not growing well and had difficulty in walking. All common diagnoses were ruled out through multiple tests and yet a final diagnosis seemed elusive. After a particularly severe bout, she was referred for genetic testing, which led to the diagnosis of Gaucher disease.
 
Gaucher is a rare genetic disorder due to absence of an important enzyme that causes enlargement of the spleen or liver, bone abnormalities and blood disorders. It is estimated to affect more than 20,000 kids like Alka in India.
 
Timely diagnosis and taking the right Enzyme Replacement Therapy under the supervision of doctors helps in addressing many health issues related to Gaucher disease. There are success stories of Alka and others living with Gaucher who are happily married, have children, pursue their passion and lead a near-normal life, thanks to their early diagnosis and access to treatment. 
 
Although rare diseases are individually uncommon, 7,000+ identified rare diseases collectively affect 300 million people worldwide*. People with rare diseases are not just statistics - they are individuals with hopes, dreams, and potential.
 
This International Gaucher Day, let our collective Roar for Rare become louder. Start one conversation today and join us in our endeavour to spread awareness on Gaucher disease. After all, #EveryLifeIsPrecious

"Organ Donation: Bridging the Gap Between Need and Hope

~ 2 lakh patients are diagnosed with End Stage Kidney Disease every year in India. Yet, only ~5% of patients receive a kidney transplant*. This critical gap between the need for organs and willingness of donors in India can be narrowed by addressing common myths that prevent potential donors from coming forward.

Take a moment to ask yourself - what stops you from signing up your organs for donation or donating to your loved ones in need? In fact, ~90% of kidney transplants are made possible through living and related donors from immediate family*.

As we commemorate World Organ Donation Day today, let's remember that sharing an organ is like sharing the gift of life. Consider pledging your organs today. Learn more about kidney donation: http://spkl.io/6049AKN83

"🌈“Even when I was a kid, I already knew I was different.” 

Meet Mark from Sanofi Philippines. His Living Out Loud journey is one of quiet courage, self-acceptance, and the people who stood by him. 💙

He grew up aware of his true identity, but kept it all to himself for years until college, where seeing others come out gave him the encouragement to do the same. When he finally told his family, their response surprised him: “They said they already knew, and they accepted it. It was such a relief.” 

At Sanofi, Mark found that same sense of belonging. “I’ve never been treated differently here. I feel respected, and I can be myself.” 🌞🌺🌟 He believes that when people can be authentic at work, they thrive, allowing them to be more confident and to build stronger relationships based on trust. 🤝

Now accompanied by a loving partner, Mark is filled with even more pride and confidence. He shares this message for anyone still holding back: “There’s nothing wrong with you. In this journey, you are not alone.” 💛

"Der Weltkrebstag am 4. Februar steht unter dem Motto „United by Unique“, wobei die Menschen selbst und nicht die Erkrankung im Mittelpunkt stehen. Doch was können Betroffene mit der Diagnose Multiples Myelom tun, um bestmöglich mitten im Leben zu bleiben?

Patientin Edith beispielsweise geht ihren eigenen Weg. Nach ihrer ersten Therapie schließt die Wahlschweizerin eine Ausbildung zur Sterbebegleiterin ab. Mit dem Thema Tod ist sie vertraut, auch aufgrund von persönlichen Schicksalsschlägen. „Doch jetzt wollte ich es richtig lernen und anderen helfen“, so Ediths emotionale Eingeständnis. Das Gefühl, gebraucht zu werden, begleitet sie seitdem wieder. Anhand persönlicher Erfahrungen beschreibt sie, wie Krebspatient*innen unterschiedliche Phasen durchleben – darunter auch Trauer und Zorn – bevor sie die Krankheit annehmen können. Heute sagt sie über sich selbst: „Ich und mein Krebsli gehören zusammen.“ 

Ediths inspirierender Umgang mit der Diagnose Multiples Myelom führt uns vor Augen, wofür der Wahlspruch des diesjährigen Weltkrebstages steht.

"Adopting regenerative agriculture isn’t easy. 🌱

Our Group CEO, Jeff Rowe, is seeing this firsthand as he experiments with regenerative practices on his family’s 3,000-acre farm in Illinois.

Regen ag is about more than reducing environmental impact—it’s a systems-level approach to enhance soil health, increase productivity, and drive long-term sustainability. Like any experiment, it comes with risks, uncertainties…and a few unexpected detours.

In this video, Jeff dives into:
- The role of cover crops in building soil resilience. ⚡
- How biologicals could be integrated into his crop protection program. 🛡️
- Why collaboration matters—with insights from Syngenta soil scientist Abbey Wick, Ph.D. and biologicals expert Joe Bogle. 🤝

And yes—there’s still room for joy in farming, like blazing across the field in a UTV on a sunny day to map out borders for perennial plantings.

"На 15 май отбелязваме Международния ден на семейството – повод да се замислим за здравето и благополучието на нашите близки. ​ 
Фамилната хиперхолестеролемия (ФХ) е наследствено заболяване, което води до високи нива на ""лошия"" LDL холестерол и повишен риск от сърдечносъдови инциденти като инфаркт и инсулт. Тъй като се предава генетично, ако един член на семейството страда от ФХ, то и други роднини могат да бъдат засегнати. Въпреки това, около 80% от хората с ФХ не са диагностицирани и не подозират за състоянието си. 
В Амджен вярваме, че информираността и ранната диагностика са ключови за превенцията на сериозни здравословни проблеми. Ето защо ви насърчаваме – поговорете със семейството си за здравословните проблеми на вашите баба и дядо, чичо и леля. Споделете тази информация със своя лекар и той ще прецени риска от ФХ.​

The support and understanding from colleagues at Amgen have been instrumental to my growth and forward trajectory as an athlete.""

"Despite affecting 1 in 5 people worldwide, high Lipoprotein(a) is an underdiagnosed and emerging risk factor for cardiovascular disease. 

Unlike LDL cholesterol, up to 90% of a person’s Lp(a) level is genetically inherited and therefore cannot be managed effectively through lifestyle changes. 

Despite its role in cardiovascular disease, high Lp(a) is often missed in routine clinical practice, as many standard lipid panels do not measure it. 

At Amgen, we are committed to advancing cardiovascular care by supporting awareness, innovation, and action. 

This #LpaAwarenessDay, let's close the gap in cardiovascular risk assessment and empower patients with the knowledge they need."

"Delays in the initiation of antiretroviral therapy remain a key challenge in the effort to help end the #HIV epidemic. But what do people living with HIV think about earlier initiation of treatment? ​
​
Our new global survey – highlighting the experiences of 2,532 people living with HIV from 11 countries – reveals that nearly 40% of respondents waited more than 30 days following a diagnosis to start treatment. Yet, rapid initiation can lead to an undetectable viral load sooner, reducing the risk of transmission and improving overall health outcomes. ​

How can we help bridge this gap? By engaging, listening and responding to the real-world needs of people and communities affected by HIV.  Learn more about our person-centric approach and research at #IAS2025. https://gilead.inc/4nVbbsU"

"Stay Alert: Protect Yourself from Hiring Scams

We continue to see an alarming rise in increasingly sophisticated recruiting scams targeting job seekers. At Regeneron, your safety and security are top priorities, and we want to ensure you’re informed and protected. Here's what you need to know:

Key Details to Watch For:
- You receive an email claiming to be from a legitimate recruiter at a reputable company.
- Upon closer inspection, the email address is a non-corporate domain.
- The “recruiter” references specific details from your LinkedIn profile, making the communication seem authentic.
- They share a link to a real job posting and ask for your resume once you express interest.
- After reviewing your resume, they claim discrepancies between your LinkedIn profile and resume could hinder your chances of success.
- They then offer to connect you with a “professional resume writer” for a small fee to “fix” the issue.

Important Reminders:
- Legitimate recruiters will always use official company email addresses (e.g., @regeneron.com).
- Real recruiters will never create fear or doubt about your qualifications.
- Authentic recruiters will never recommend or require paid services of any kind.

This type of scam is distressing for everyone involved, and we urge you to remain vigilant. If you encounter suspicious communications, verify their authenticity by reaching out to us directly: https://lnkd.in/efiFcp2a.

"#NEWS: Published in American Chemical Society’s Journal of Medicinal Chemistry — and on the magazine’s front cover — our first-ever article (Perspectives) on the therapeutic application of a class of nucleic acid therapeutics (NATs) called oligonucleotides.  
 
Oligonucleotides, like siRNA and antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs), have great potential to unlock therapeutics for previously “undruggable” conditions because they can potentially silence specific disease-causing genes. 
 
These advancements aim to expand siRNA and ASO-based therapeutics and enable precise targeting of tissues beyond the liver, including muscle, skin, cardiovascular, and eyes. 
 
As these opportunities are evaluated, it’s critical to continue optimizing stability, targeting, and systemic delivery to unlock the full potential of oligonucleotide therapies to treat other diseases.

"Je früher erkannt, desto besser behandelbar – das gilt auch bei Friedreich-Ataxie.💡 
 
Friedreich-Ataxie (FA) ist eine seltene, genetisch bedingte neurodegenerative Erkrankung, deren erste Zeichen sich meist im Jugendalter zwischen 10 und 15 Jahren zeigen, mitunter aber auch erst viel später im Erwachsenenalter spürbar werden. Oft bleiben sie lange unerkannt. 
 
Genau deshalb ist eine frühzeitige Diagnose entscheidend, um: 
✔ Symptome richtig zu deuten 
✔ eine Behandlung und Begleitung zu ermöglichen 
✔ den Alltag der Patient*innen bestmöglich zu unterstützen

"Imagine a medicine that doesn’t just block a disease-causing protein, but removes it entirely. At Biogen, we’re working to advance targeted protein degradation to do just that. From PROTACs to molecular glue degraders, our scientists are exploring innovative ways to neutralize harmful proteins in neurodegenerative, immune-mediated, and rare diseases.

"Wann ist eine Erkrankung eine “seltene Erkrankung??💡 

In der EU gilt eine Erkrankung als selten, wenn weniger als 5 von 10.000 Menschen betroffen sind. Doch in der Summe betrifft das rund vier Millionen Menschen in Deutschland – eine Zahl, die in der Versorgung oft unterschätzt wird. 

Für Ärzt*innen, Therapeut*innen und Pflegekräfte bedeutet das: 

👉 Seltene Erkrankungen sind häufiger, als man denkt. 

👉 Sie erfordern ein hohes Maß an individueller Betreuung. 

👉 Und: Sie brauchen mehr Sichtbarkeit – medizinisch, gesellschaftlich wie politisch. 

Die richtige Diagnose, passende Behandlungsmaßnahmen und ein vertrauensvolles Arzt-Patienten-Verhältnis sind entscheidend – gerade bei seltenen neurologischen Erkrankungen. 

Jede „Rare Disease” beginnt mit einer genauen Beobachtung. Lasst uns gemeinsam aufmerksam bleiben, zuhören und Wege finden, um Diagnosen zu beschleunigen und die Versorgung zu verbessern.💪​

"June is CMV Awareness Month—a time dedicated to raising awareness about cytomegalovirus (CMV), the leading infectious cause of birth defects in the United States. As part of this effort, our #StimulatingtheScience initiative recognizes and celebrates important, peer-reviewed research that advances our understanding of CMV and supports efforts to improve prevention, diagnosis and care.
 
The first study we are recognizing for our initiative is by Dr. Mallory Baker, et al., and is titled, “Timing of Congenital Cytomegalovirus Diagnosis and Missed Opportunities”.

This study sheds light on how delayed diagnoses of congenital CMV (cCMV) can result in missed opportunities for early treatment, monitoring and intervention. Nearly half of the infants in the cohort were not diagnosed until after 3 weeks of age, with some diagnoses occurring well after the onset of sensorineural hearing loss. The findings emphasize the importance of early screening strategies—including universal and expanded targeted approaches—to prevent diagnostic delays and improve developmental outcomes.
 
We thank Dr. Baker and her colleagues for their meaningful contribution to the field and for helping shape the case for improved cCMV detection and care pathways.

"Can large-scale seed production be a part of the climate solution? We believe so—and we’re proving that it can.

Partnering with 110,000 seed production farmers in 19 countries, we’re embedding regenerative agriculture practices into contracted seed production hectares to reduce environmental impacts and help restore ecosystems around the world.

Here are 5 ways it’s making a difference:
• Restoring soil health
• Rebuilding biodiversity
• Helping farmers manage their irrigation
• Cutting emissions
• Scaling global impact through encouraging commercial hectare adoption too

"Farmers can’t control the weather, but they can choose how to respond to it. ⚡️

Crops like wheat, soy, and corn often show early signs of drought stress, and without timely intervention, these plants will wither, deprived of the nutrients they need to thrive. But what if we could make these crops more resilient to drought?

This World Day to Combat Desertification and Drought, we're sharing how new technologies can make crops more resilient with the power of science. Our agronomists have observed that certain classes of fungicides can improve the yield of these crops, both in the presence of biotic stress caused by pathogens and of abiotic stress from environmental conditions like heat or drought.

In these sample images, untreated corn shows stunted kernel development, with dry, discoloured silks—all signs of water stress in pollination. By contrast, the treated crop appears fuller and healthier.

This is what resilience looks like in action. 💪

"This year marks a major milestone for us—25 years of agricultural innovation! 🌱

As we celebrate key achievements on World Environment Day, we’re proud to announce the coating of nearly every Syngenta vegetable seed planted in Europe is now free from microplastics. These coatings are critical for growers, protecting valuable crops by giving the plant a better chance of flourishing once the seed is in the ground.

This milestone is the result of four years of dedicated research by our Syngenta Vegetable Seeds team, who developed these biodegradable seed coatings that protect crops and enhance yields, while being kinder to our soils. Although agriculture’s contribution to global microplastic pollution is less than 2% globally, this is an issue our industry takes seriously. Want to find out more? Check out our story link in the comments.

We're dedicated to developing innovative solutions and can’t wait to see what breakthroughs the next 25 years will bring. 💚

"Malaria claims roughly 600,000 lives a year— most of those tragically among children under five. Its toll is even higher when a farmer falls ill during harvest, as the impact on local food security and livelihoods can be devastating.

“Not only are there deaths, but the people who get sick, they cannot work, they cannot go to school, they cannot cultivate their fields, and this all has a huge cost and impact on their lives and livelihoods,” says Syngenta’s Dr Rose Peter, an expert in vector control.

While traditional insecticides have long played a role in malaria control, rising resistance among mosquitoes demands a new strategy.

Our Sovrenta®️ solution is a next-generation insecticide that targets the mosquito’s nervous system to induce rapid paralysis and death. The World Health Organization has just pre-qualified Sovrenta®️— just in time for the rainy season surge.

As World Malaria Day approaches on April 25, Sovrenta®️’s approval marks a significant milestone in addressing this preventable disease that strikes the world’s emerging economies hardest.

As Dr. Peter puts it, “Malaria and poverty go together, and one of the best ways to help is by alleviating the effects of malaria by preventing it.”

"Syngenta Pakistan goes solar reaffirming its commitment to sustainable business practices

More than a decade ago, Syngenta Group was one of the first companies in the industry to launch a plan that served as the organization’s sustainability compass. With the global population on track to reach 9.7 billion by 2050, farmers need to grow more food while reducing their impact on the environment and safeguarding natural resources.

Syngenta aims to reduce the intensity of its footprint by 68 percent based on value added by 2030 compared to the 2016 baseline. This target is consistent with reductions required to limit global warming to well below 2°C compared to pre-industrial levels. To achieve the 2030 carbon intensity reduction target, Syngenta is focusing on improving the efficiency of its manufacturing processes, designing and implementing site-based energy-saving programs, increasing the share of renewable sources of energy, and partnering with its crop protection and seed suppliers to reduce their carbon footprint. The environmental sustainability requirements outlined in the HSE Code of Practice on Environmental Sustainability ensure that Syngenta operations are aware of their resources usage and implement programs to conserve natural resources, minimize environmental impact, and adopt more sustainable practices. These requirements cover various aspects of environmental sustainability, including greenhouse gas emissions reduction and optimizing logistics network.

Syngenta Pakistan is fully aligned with Syngenta Group’s sustainability vision. Syngenta’s supply chain accounts for about 90 percent of Syngenta’s total carbon footprint, while 10 percent of emissions come from Syngenta’s operations. Focusing on reducing the GHG emissions Syngenta, Pakistan embarked on a mission to convert their manufacturing facility in Karachi and their warehouses across the country including Lahore, Multan and Rahimyar Khan onto solar energy. Syngenta, Pakistan has installed over 300KW of solar capacity across its facilities. This initiative has not only helped the business bring down its operational cost but has also helped Syngenta, Pakistan to move onto a renewable source of green energy. 

On inaugurating the solar energy system at Syngenta’s plant in Karachi- Country General Manager- Zeeshan Hasib Baig said “This is an important milestone for Syngenta, Pakistan to be converting its manufacturing facility onto Solar Energy. As a responsible corporate entity Syngenta is committed to playing its part in ensuring sustainable growth”.
